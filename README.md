A browser-style web interface by Jelly Rock LLC

🌐 About Jelly-Web

Jelly-Web is a custom web browser interface built using simple web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
The goal of Jelly-Web is to create a student-friendly proxy browser that can open other websites through an embedded window.

This version is an early prototype and currently works as a visual browser UI.
The proxy system will be added later.
